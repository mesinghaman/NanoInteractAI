# Drug Modification Prediction via Micro-Nanoparticle Interactions

**In collaboration with the Department of Nanotechnology, VIT Vellore**

This project aims to analyze and predict drug modifications caused by micro- and nano-particle interactions using advanced machine learning techniques. We leverage few-shot learning with LLMs, XGBoost, and GraphSAGE to understand and model complex nanoparticle-induced alterations in drug behavior.

 ðŸ”¬ Project Overview
Micro-nanoparticles can significantly influence drug stability, release, and bioavailability. This project presents predictive models to:

Detect potential drug modifications

Understand nanoparticle-drug interaction patterns

Support nanoformulation design using data-driven insights
